<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Wilson</h1>
<h3 align="center">A passionate Data Architect/Data Engineer</h3>

As a Data Architect/Engineer with a background in data engineering and data science, I design and deliver scalable lakehouse architectures, high-quality data pipelines, and reliable analytics ecosystems. I work across Python, SQL, and SAS, and have hands-on experience with Azure, Fabric, GCP, AWS, Snowflake, and Oracle ERP integrations. My recent work includes architecting Databricks Unity Catalog migrations, improving end-to-end pipeline performance, and implementing governance frameworks that ensure consistency and compliance. I also build big-data solutions with Spark and Hadoop and use DevOps practices to support CI/CD workflows.

I am certified as a Microsoft Azure Data Engineer and a Google Cloud Professional Data Engineer. My GitHub projects showcase my skills in data engineering, machine learning, custom Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with vector databases.

Feel free to explore my GitHub profile for more on my projects and contributions to the open-source community.

## Some of my projects:
| Project Link | Tools | Project Description |
|--------------|-------|---------------------|
| [EnergyStocks Historical Price DataPipeline](https://github.com/WilsonH918/EnergyStocks_HistoricalPrice_DataPipeline) | Pyspark, SQL, AWS (Lambda, EC2, S3), Snowflake (CDC), PowerBI | This is a data pipeline project that retrieves S&P500 listed energy companies' historical stock price data, stores the data in an AWS S3 bucket, and transforms the data in a Snowflake data warehouse. The project is automated using AWS Lambda to trigger a Python script that runs the pipeline on a scheduled basis. |
| [RAG based Document Retrieval with ChromaDB and Vector Embeddings](https://github.com/WilsonH918/RAG-based-Document-Retrieval-with-ChromaDB-and-Vector-Embeddings) | Python, OpenAI API, ChromaDB, LangChain, BeautifulSoup, Requests | ChromaQuery is an AI-powered knowledge retrieval system that integrates retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), web scraping, and ChromaDB for accurate and real-time responses. The system uses OpenAI embeddings and vector-based search to retrieve relevant articles and generate contextual answers. It scrapes content from the web, stores articles as chunks in a database, and queries relevant information to generate insightful responses. |
| [FabricOps MCP-Driven Data Architecture](https://github.com/WilsonH918/fabric-custom-remote-mcp) | Python, Azure Functions, Model Context Protocol (MCP), Microsoft Fabric REST API, Power BI | A custom remote MCP server hosted on Azure Functions that acts as a data architecture integration layer for AI agents. It exposes MCP tools defined in `server.py` to enable secure orchestration of Microsoft Fabric and Power BI operations—such as workspace creation, report analysis, DAX execution, and automated fixes—via REST APIs and enterprise-grade governance. |
| [ERC20 Data Ingestion Pipeline](https://github.com/WilsonH918/Data_Pipeline_ETL_Pipeline_Web3_Token) | Python, Airflow (DAGs), PostgreSQL, Docker, Hadoop | This project is designed to extract ERC20 token data from Web3 using the Etherscan API and create an ETL pipeline using Apache Airflow. The extracted data is scheduled to be fed into a local PostgreSQL database daily. The project involves technologies such as Docker, Airflow DAGs, PostgreSQL, and HDFS. Below is the screenshot of the data pipeline in action. |
| [DataOps Fabric Provisioner IaC](https://github.com/WilsonH918/Fabric-Workspace-Deployer-GitHub-Actions) | GitHub Actions, Python, Jinja2, Microsoft Fabric API | A CI/CD-style automation framework for provisioning Microsoft Fabric workspaces and lakehouses. It leverages GitHub Actions pipelines for orchestration, Python scripts for authentication and deployment, and Jinja2 templates for dynamic configuration rendering. The solution enables Infrastructure-as-Code practices in Fabric, delivering reproducible, version-controlled, and scalable environment deployments across multiple clients and projects. |
| [Real time Streaming of ERC20 Transactions with Kafka and Python](https://github.com/WilsonH918/Real-time-Streaming-of-ERC20-Transactions-with-Kafka-and-Python) | Python, SQL, Kafka, Docker, Web3 | This project demonstrates how to build a real-time data pipeline to retrieve ERC20 token transactions and store them in a local CSV file. The project uses Apache Kafka, an open-source distributed streaming platform, to stream real-time data from the Etherscan API, a blockchain explorer for the Ethereum network, and then stores the data in CSV format in a local file. |
| [Thesis Code - Motion Heatmap and Machine Learning for Stair Climbing Detection](https://github.com/WilsonH918/Stair-Climbing-Descending-Analysis-using-Silhouettes) | Pyspark, Pandas, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Matplotlib, Seaborn | This code repository contains the code used to generate the results presented in my thesis titled "Motion Heatmap and Machine Learning for Stair Climbing Detection." In this thesis, we present a dataset of video data that includes bounding boxes information and silhouette images, along with the methods used to process this data to detect human movements, trajectories over time, and the usage of each room in the home environment. |
| [ERC20 MyToken](https://github.com/WilsonH918/ERC20_MyToken) | Solidity, Python, Web3, Blockchain | This is a simple ERC20 token contract written in Solidity. It allows for the creation, transfer, and burning of tokens. The contract also includes an onlyOwner modifier to restrict access to certain functions. |
